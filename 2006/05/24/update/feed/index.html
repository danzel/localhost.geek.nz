		<description><![CDATA[I have a suggestion for a future version of AFKIM (or AFKIRC)...  Are you aware of Brettspielwelt?  It&#039;s a server that hosts various German boardgames, and with the official Java client or the web applet you can connect and play games with other people online.  I discovered recently that someone started writing an open source client (sort of an IRC bridge), and the code is available at: http://freshmeat.net/projects/bsw-proxy/

I&#039;d love it if you could get this working as an option under AFKIM.  Even if it&#039;s only possible to chat with people on the server, that would still be cool. :-)

I&#039;ve been working on my own to try to decipher the mounds of data that pass between the BSW server and client, in the hopes that one day I can cobble together a working client and be able to play some of these games on my PSP.  Currently, I&#039;ve got my crappy client logging in to the server, but it&#039;s not really doing much else.  I haven&#039;t started to dig deeply into the code I posted at the link above, but I&#039;m hoping it will get me a bit further.

I couldn&#039;t find an email address for you so I figured I&#039;d post here in the hopes that you read your blog comments.  Let me know if the BSW stuff interests you at all.  I&#039;m personally more interested in playing some of the games on the PSP, but I have to get the protocol stuff working before that&#039;s possible.

Great job with AFKIM, by the way!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey dude, AFKIM is rad.  I tried to use peldet as an irc client, but the keyboard gave me a headache.  The thing I&#039;d most like to see in a future release from you is an Irc client using the danzeff keyboard.  Keep up the good work.]]></description>
