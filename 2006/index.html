			<p>I’ve made a bot based on the irc++lib codebase to make some use of it and to replace the eggdrop bots that were looking after the channels I hang in. eggdrop has served them well but I really don’t know tcl (the scripting language used in eggdrop), so I decided I would integrate php into irc++bot as the scripting language.</p>
<p>This has been very successful so far with an auto-op script being simple to make, and I’ve been supplied with a php class to do searches and grab movie details on the site imdb.com which is very useful (Thanks Randy!). I’m now in the position where I can easily create new functionality for the bot, which I plan to do 🙂</p>
<p>MANY THANKS to those who have created the embed SAPI for PHP, it is awesome to work with 🙂 and made this a breaze to implement.</p>
<p>Come check it out in #hamlan on undernet if you want to see it in action nicks starting with _’s are bots.</p>

			<p>This is my entry for the neoflash competition.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,3001.0.html">Neoflash Post</a></p>
<h2><a xhref="http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,3049.0.html">Vote me 🙂</a></h2>
<p>Ever got annoyed at a PSP game because it had bad controls?<br>
Well be annoyed no more! RemaPSP is here to save the day!</p>
<p>RemaPSP is a program to remap the PSP controls. It also supports turbo (Rapid Fire!) and Macros.<br>
You can remap any of your psp controls to any other. Including taking input from the remote.<br>
It works with Devhook and has a launcher for 1.5 homebrew.</p>
<p>Check the included readme for install, usage, modding instructions.</p>
<p>I plan to release the source code later this week when I have some more time.<br>
If any of the Devhook cheat engine coders want to add this to their system, drop me an email 🙂</p>
<p>Thanks to Haeal and Ayb4btu for the eboot art and to Lordsturm + Macca for their Beta testing help.</p>

<p>I’ve been busy with exams and <a href="http://www.hamlan.co.nz">hamlan</a> the last few weeks (and the rest of this one!)</p>
<p>I’ve been learning/learnt opengl in there however, and I’m planning to release a game for the pspupdates/lik-sang games contest in a while. Although I’ll probably be done beforehand… Maybe I’ll recode it to really use the 3d to its fullest 😉<br>
No hints towards what it is though, just that its good.<br>
Yeah, thats right, I know its good and I haven’t made it! 😛</p>

			<p>Since I’ve blabbed this all over the peldet release thread on pspupdates I may as well post it here 🙂</p>
<p>I’ve been quite busy with work and University recently, so my PSP dev time has been at a minimum.</p>
<p><b>Heres my current homebrew todo list:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Integrate afkim + maybe others into pspradio plugins (webnab needs a fairly big rewrite to get in so I may not bother for now, infact I will leave peldet untill its had its next big rewrite too)</li>
<li>Split peldet+afkim into “afkim” (im client), “afkirc” (irc client), “peldet” (telnet/ssh client). These will all be pspradio plugins aswell as standalone apps.</li>
<li>Add ssh to peldet</li>
<li>Make all my apps better.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have currently managed to get afkim working in pspradio, although there is still a bit of work to do before I can add it as a proper plugin.<br>
Peldet will be getting the new danzeff keyboard in addition to the current psprint keyboard, I will make a modified danzeff to make it better for use with telnet/ssh.<br>
AFKIRC will be based off the irc core that I rewrote for AFKIM, which was based on the IRC code I originally wrote for peldet (much improved however, hahaha). The code is now generic enough that it could be used to easily make an irc client for most any system, so I may make a libirc from it in the future if I have the time 🙂<br>
This IRC code still needs some improvements for more generic IRC use, but it is coming along nicely and I’ve managed to hack together a AFKIRC test client from it without too many changes. Currently when it has errors it just stops working, and pm’s and a whole lot of other useful messages get parsed and thrown away, which isn’t very useful.<br>
The current codebase shouldn’t be toooo difficult to get multiple channel support into, so expect that to happen at some stage 🙂</p>

<p><b>New OSK</b><br>

<p>The new theme is by Randy, many thanks to him 🙂 (old theme is gone gone gone)<br>
New input method is in of course, looks pretty much done (except the bug documented in that screenshot, lol)<br>
For those that enjoy it, p_sprint is still in there as an option. (default will be the new OSK, danzeff)<br>
I’m going to spend the next week fixing bugs and getting some more functionality in and hopefully we should see a release in a weeks time. 🙂</p>
