			<p>I was lucky enough to attend <a href="http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au/" target="_blank">YOW!</a> in Melbourne last week, here is a braindump of what I went to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fa/locations/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fc/schedule/topics/556bf609e81b83070a0000dc?track=Keynote&framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au" target="_blank">It’s Complicated…</a></p>
<p><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fa/locations/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fc/schedule/topics/56527778a7e16fff0400004b?track=People+%26+Process&framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au" target="_blank">Virtual Teams: Making Them Work</a></p>
<p>Interesting talk on Virtual Teams (Not remote teams). A Virtual Team is where (ideally) everyone is remote. Some takeaways:<br>
Almost everyone in the room used Slack.<br>
When there is an office and some people remote, if the people in the office all go in to a room to have a call with remote people, this will make the remote people feel even more remote as the people together will have a conversation between themselves that they can’t really be a part of.</p>
<p><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fa/locations/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fc/schedule/topics/561f2d5a02a8ab08a30000c7?track=Mobile&framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au" target="_blank">Rethinking MVC with React Native & ReactiveCocoa</a></p>
<p>React Native is a React Framework for doing native looking mobile apps using javascript and React.  It looks pretty awesome.</p>
<p>ReactiveCocoa is a React style framework for Cocoa UI, also looks pretty awesome.</p>
<p><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fa/locations/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fc/schedule/topics/5577b209f50fe03a39000198?track=Architecture+%26+Design&framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au" target="_blank">Pragmatic Microservices: Whether, When and How to Migrate</a></p>
<p>This was an excellent talk. Randy went through lots of things around moving towards a microservice architecture, recommend watching this one back when the vids arrive.</p>
<p><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fa/locations/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fc/schedule/topics/5577b11877c84e50e8003a8c?track=Languages&framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au" target="_blank">Production Haskell</a></p>

<p>Another really good talk, talked about how they added lots of custom logic and processing to their app without making it a mess.<br>
Spoilers: Preprocessing data, hook points to allow specific extensions and validation.</p>
<p><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fa/locations/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fc/schedule/topics/5577afbff50fe0f69e000187?track=People+%26+Process&framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au" target="_blank">Frugal Innovation and Scaffolding software</a></p>
<p>Really good feel good talk on innovation in Africa, when the video comes up make sure you watch it!</p>
<p><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fa/locations/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fc/schedule/topics/556bfa40e81b83f9c50000e3?track=Keynote&framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au" target="_blank">Thriving in a Stochastic World</a></p>

<p>Really Really good talk for anyone doing scrum, Slides are online but don’t make sense by themselves, watch out for the video.</p>
<p>Talks about the human-improvement side of this process, writing down what skills people think they have and what they’d like to improve on. Forming scrum teams based on the work that needs doing rather than trying to fit the work to the team.</p>
<p><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fa/locations/54fafe79d02ecad6f60001fc/schedule/topics/56020150de720a387100057f?track=Cloud&framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au" target="_blank">Facebook’s Product Infrastructure</a></p>

<p>Good talk about the practice of Software Engineering. Everyone talks about how Software engineering isn’t real engineering, but when you delve in to it it turns out it is.</p>

			</h1>
								</header>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Simpulls launched on iOS two weeks ago, this was the same week that Zombie Match Defense launched, which has been in the press due to it’s <a href="https://medium.com/@jakesones/the-story-of-a-decent-game-failing-46249e876ce6">self proclaimed failed launch</a>.<br>
Simpulls unfortunately didn’t receive an Apple feature on launch, so it’s been even more quiet.</p>
<p>Simpulls has been received well by those who have picked it up, it’s sitting at 4.5 stars globally, even with some negative reviews from the French store – it turns out that Simpulls crashes on launch in this region 🙁 A fix has been submitted for this however!</p>
<p>This wasn’t the only issue, there have been a few random crash errors which are also fixed in the upcoming update. Finding all the bugs as a tiny team is really hard. The most annoying one is that in level 60 (a Totems and Mages level) some times people will get to the end of the level and not have enough totem pieces. I believe I’ve fixed this now (Pretty certain mages were clearing totem pieces), but I haven’t been able to reproduce it, so I’m not 100% sure.</p>
<p>Having your game launch on iOS without an Apple feature is a deathbell, your game will almost never be seen by anyone, thankfully I have been lucky enough to meet some of the amazing people who release games on iOS and they were awesome enough to do some cross promotion for me.</p>
<p>Thanks to these awesome people, we’ve managed to get a few hundred players, almost a thousand. This isn’t as much as I would have hoped, but overall I’m okay with it. It’s not enough to make any money, but considering this is the first game I’ve released in 5 years, at least there are people out there enjoying it finally.</p>
<p>So where to from here? The Android version will be releasing early December, I’m just working on the final touches now. After that we’ll probably release on windows phone too (replacing the old unity version) and any other mobile platforms I can get to.</p>
<p>Hopefully it does well enough somewhere to make it worthwhile to do a proper content update, we have a few more cool things we’d like to add in but we haven’t had the time. Sadly it isn’t worth working on for the amount of people we having playing it now 🙁</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and if you haven’t already got Simpulls, go <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simpulls/id543097707?ls=1&mt=8">grab it on the app store now.</a> (And tell your friends)</p>

			<p>For the last 5 years I’ve been working part time on a mobile game called Simpulls. If you follow me anywhere you’ve probably seen or heard something about it… It’s been a long journey, but I’ve learnt a lot and met a lot of awesome people.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simpulls is a cartoony and quirky swipe based old-school matching game. Unleash the powers of the special Simpulls you discover on your journey through their lands to help you overcome the variety of challenges you encounter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simpulls is our ode to some of our past favourite puzzle games: Magical Drop, Puyo Puyo and Puzzle Bobble. We wanted to bring something new to touch puzzle gaming, something not bejeweled inspired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So ready your fingers for some fast paced Simpull matching action. Save Simpulls by matching together 3 or more of the same color. Grab and release Simpulls using simple swipe gestures. Discover the lost tribes of the Simpull warriors, mysterious mages and you might even encounter the rare freedom portals. Are you ready?</span></p>

								</header>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">What is a microservice</a></p>
<p>First, you need to learn about the go language. Do these pages in order to learn the bare basics:<br>
<a href="https://tour.golang.org/">https://tour.golang.org/</a><br>
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">https://golang.org/doc/install</a><br>
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html">https://golang.org/doc/code.html</a></p>
<p>Then you’ll need to learn what docker is, read the understanding docker page:<br>
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/introduction/understanding-docker/">https://docs.docker.com/introduction/understanding-docker/</a></p>
<p>And then go install docker and run their hello-world example:<br>
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/installation/">https://docs.docker.com/installation/</a></p>
<p>Now hopefully you have the basics of go and docker down, so let’s grab an existing microservice and set it up.</p>
<p>On your docker host run:</p>
<pre>wget https://github.com/danzel/go-docker-playground/archive/master.tar.gz
tar -zxf master.tar.gz
cd go-docker-playground-master
docker build --tag=danzel/go-docker-playground:1.0 .</pre>
<p>This will fetch and then build this docker image which contains a simple web server. Now we can start it up with:</p>
<pre>docker create --name=test -P danzel/go-docker-playground:1.0
docker start test</pre>
<p>Docker will automatically expose the server on a free port (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/danzel/go-docker-playground/blob/master/Dockerfile#L10">EXPOSE</a> in the Dockerfile and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#create">-P</a> in the docker create command line).<br>
To see the port it has chosen:</p>
<pre>docker ps</pre>
<p>Then you should be able to open it by browsing to http://dockerhostip:port</p>

			</h1>
								</header>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>When you have a popular repository on github, you can get a lot of Pull Requests.</p>
<p>Some of these are good, some need work and some should never be merged. As the maintainer it is your job to figure out what category each PR fits in to, work with the original author to fix any issues and finally do the merge.</p>
<p>But how do you decide what PRs should actually end up in the project?</p>
<p>The naive view would be to merge every feature. But what if that feature is only useful to one person? Is the person submitting that PR going to stick around to maintain their code in the future or (more likely) is maintaining that code going to fall to you? Is the feature even something that other users want?</p>
<p>Every change adds extra weight to the project that must be carried and updated when any refactoring is done. These features also add complication to the project that can hinder further changes. Sometimes the best change is one that makes the project more extensible without adding any features itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The way I deal with PRs that I’m not certain about is to let them sit. If someone else wants them they’ll hopefully come along and comment on them. Usually this works well, PRs that add or fix urgently needed things tend to have people on there asking for them to be merged.</p>
<p>Sometimes your PR won’t get merged or looked at because the maintainer has other things to do. The people who maintain projects on Github are people, they only have a limited amount of time in their day and they probably have a job they should be doing.</p>
<p>And finally sometimes the maintainer will miss the notifications so your PR never gets looked at. So don’t get too upset when things don’t get merged, wait a while</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>
<h3>Ways to help your PR be merged</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explain why your change exists</li>
<li>Add tests</li>
<li>Fix build errors</li>
<li>Change anything that is requested</li>
<li>Bump it after a weeks in case the maintainer has missed it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ways to help your PR not be merged</h3>
<ul>
<li>Break the build</li>
<li>Do a large amount of changes</li>
<li>Include automatically generated files</li>
</ul>

			<p>Grab the .deb file from their cydia repo http://www.libretro.com/index.php/downloads/</p>
<p>Extract it with “ar xv something.deb” (I had to use a linux machine for this)</p>
<p>Create an Entitlements.plist like on here:<br>
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15634188/resigning-an-ios-provisioning-profile<br>
(The example is missing </plist> )<br>
Replacing the application-identifier with one compatible with your signing cert.</p>
<p>Save the following as r.b64 (This file gets created automatically if you build the project)</p>
<pre>nBsaXN0MDDRAQJVcnVsZXPTAwQFBgcMUi4qXxATUmVzb3VyY2VSdWxlcy5wbGlz

AAAAAAAACQgLERgbMTw9QklOV1hdZgAAAAAAAAEBAAAAAAAAAA8AAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAABn</pre>
<p>Convert it into ResourceRules.plist with:</p>
<pre>cat r.b64 | openssl base64 -d > RetroArch.app/ResourceRules.plist</pre>
<p>Run roughly these commands:</p>
<p>$CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY – Your signing name, check “Keychain Access”</p>
<p>$PROVISION – a copy of your provisioning profile file</p>
<pre> codesign -fs "$CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY" RetroArch.app/modules/*.dylib
 cp "$PROVISION" RetroArch.app/embedded.mobileprovision
 cp ResourceRules.plist RetroArch.app/
 codesign -f -s "$CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY" --resource-rules RetroArch.app/ResourceRules.plist --entitlements Entitlements.plist RetroArch.app
 xcrun -sdk iphoneos PackageApplication "RetroArch.app" -o "RetroArch.ipa" --sign '$CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY' --embed "RetroArch.app/embedded.mobileprovision"</pre>
<p>Install the IPA 😀</p>
