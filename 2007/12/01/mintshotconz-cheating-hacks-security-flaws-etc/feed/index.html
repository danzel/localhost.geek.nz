		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not going to add smilies support, it would require too much changes in the current framework.
Same with links2.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the update Mike

So, is it still possible to cheat in other ways or does it look like all the loopholes have been closed?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well they&#039;ve fixed the bug in the submitanswer code. You can no longer fake the answer as the correct answer is now pulled from the database.
Changes to the type are now ignored (no boosting a gold to platinum for more m$)
Invalid question id&#039;s are ignored.

Well done - Amazing what happens when some Kiwi coders get involved?

		<description><![CDATA[Hey that&#039;s great you heard from Nick. Funny, he hasn&#039;t visited our site to thank us for pointing out all the communication errors LOL. Or maybe they sneak in and out of all the blogs and forums and pick up all the clues, but all they have to do is read their emails. Lots of people have written to them about the poor coding, implementation and testing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;rinkals&#039; been busy, at least not  giving away the correct answer. I love how they pointed that out in the live version as well. Looks like the correct answer is hidden in a php file. Now, to get at that... ^^]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seriously, mintshot got all they deserved. I can&#039;t stand it when sites have had 10 times more spent on the marketing budget then the coding budget. There have been alot better sites that have bitten the dust because they couldn&#039;t get celebrity endorsements or pyrotechnics on Rangitoto.
@Pp: The only crime here was going live with such goddamn shoddy code. If it wasn&#039;t an internal hack job in creating the site, an agency would be getting seriously roasted right now! 
If I could push a parking meter button and it spat money out at me, I&#039;d push that button a few times!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow finally. :)
No one likes public security disclosures against their product. But as Ac says above, you have been informed about this and it still isn&#039;t fixed. The only way I can motivate you to fix it is to make it publicly known.
Enjoy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Nick from Mintshot here.

Thanks for bring this security issue to our attention. We certainly don&#039;t like security flaws being made public but the best way we are going to harden the solution is by listening to members and dealing with these issues quickly. 

We are currently very focused on making mintshot s fair, fun and rewarding place to hang out. 

Regards
Nick]]></description>
