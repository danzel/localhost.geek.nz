				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Simpulls launched on iOS two weeks ago, this was the same week that Zombie Match Defense launched, which has been in the press due to it&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/@jakesones/the-story-of-a-decent-game-failing-46249e876ce6">self proclaimed failed launch</a>.<br />
Simpulls unfortunately didn&#8217;t receive an Apple feature on launch, so it&#8217;s been even more quiet.</p>
<p>Simpulls has been received well by those who have picked it up, it&#8217;s sitting at 4.5 stars globally, even with some negative reviews from the French store &#8211; it turns out that Simpulls crashes on launch in this region <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> A fix has been submitted for this however!</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t the only issue, there have been a few random crash errors which are also fixed in the upcoming update. Finding all the bugs as a tiny team is really hard. The most annoying one is that in level 60 (a Totems and Mages level) some times people will get to the end of the level and not have enough totem pieces. I believe I&#8217;ve fixed this now (Pretty certain mages were clearing totem pieces), but I haven&#8217;t been able to reproduce it, so I&#8217;m not 100% sure.</p>
<p>Having your game launch on iOS without an Apple feature is a deathbell, your game will almost never be seen by anyone, thankfully I have been lucky enough to meet some of the amazing people who release games on iOS and they were awesome enough to do some cross promotion for me.</p>
<p>Thanks to these awesome people, we&#8217;ve managed to get a few hundred players, almost a thousand. This isn&#8217;t as much as I would have hoped, but overall I&#8217;m okay with it. It&#8217;s not enough to make any money, but considering this is the first game I&#8217;ve released in 5 years, at least there are people out there enjoying it finally.</p>
<p>So where to from here? The Android version will be releasing early December, I&#8217;m just working on the final touches now. After that we&#8217;ll probably release on windows phone too (replacing the old unity version) and any other mobile platforms I can get to.</p>
<p>Hopefully it does well enough somewhere to make it worthwhile to do a proper content update, we have a few more cool things we&#8217;d like to add in but we haven&#8217;t had the time. Sadly it isn&#8217;t worth working on for the amount of people we having playing it now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and if you haven&#8217;t already got Simpulls, go <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simpulls/id543097707?ls=1&amp;mt=8">grab it on the app store now.</a> (And tell your friends)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last 5 years I&#8217;ve been working part time on a mobile game called Simpulls. If you follow me anywhere you&#8217;ve probably seen or heard something about it&#8230; It&#8217;s been a long journey, but I&#8217;ve learnt a lot and met a lot of awesome people.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simpulls is a cartoony and quirky swipe based old-school matching game. Unleash the powers of the special Simpulls you discover on your journey through their lands to help you overcome the variety of challenges you encounter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simpulls is our ode to some of our past favourite puzzle games: Magical Drop, Puyo Puyo and Puzzle Bobble. We wanted to bring something new to touch puzzle gaming, something not bejeweled inspired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So ready your fingers for some fast paced Simpull matching action. Save Simpulls by matching together 3 or more of the same color. Grab and release Simpulls using simple swipe gestures. Discover the lost tribes of the Simpull warriors, mysterious mages and you might even encounter the rare freedom portals. Are you ready?</span></p>
