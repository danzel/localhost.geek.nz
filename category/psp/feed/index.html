				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you&#8217;ve obviously seen, DSP isn&#8217;t out yet and it is past the 1st of May.<br />
Well I admit, I sort of fibbed a bit when I said it was going to be out on the 1st. The 1st was actually the date that DS<strong>T </strong>had to be finished.</p>
<p><strong>DST is Defense Station <strong>Touchable, DSP for the <strong>iPhone!</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Wooooooooo!</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>On the 1st of May DST was submitted to the App Store and is currently awaiting approval for release <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The PSP version needs some more work before it can be released. The main menu needs updating and the Achievements system needs linking in.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure how many of the Maps I&#8217;ll bring over to PSP, probably not the 5 that will be released with the iPhone version, but definitely more than the 1 of previous versions.<br />
There will most likely be some memory issues to deal with, but I&#8217;ll find out when I have a look at how it runs.<br />
I&#8217;ll be testing aga</p>
<p>More detail will come later this week as I work on getting the PSP version up to scratch.</p>
<p><em>PS: Sorry I didn&#8217;t post this earlier, I drafted it and forgot to publish &gt;_&lt;</em><strong><strong><strong><strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seriously late update here&#8230;.. Anyways &gt;_&gt;</p>
<p>The menu is now mostly implemented, it shows the level name and description as well as the level image.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve fixed up all the issues I&#8217;ve encountered related to the new font being slightly wider, text wasn&#8217;t fitting on some buttons, tower upgrade menu was a total mess.</p>
<p>Pathfind now looks more natural: enemies will continue travelling in the same direction so long as it is the most efficient path.</p>
<p>Begin work on end game handling (What to do when you win/lose)</p>
<p>I also have a firm final date for the new release&#8230; So <strong>the next DSP will be out BEFORE 1st of May</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have some more awesome things to announce over the next while as I get nearer release <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Next weeks todos:</p>
<p>Finish end game handling: high score entering and recording, show high scores on main menu.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the week I pretty much finished off save/load. Currently pathfind enemies don&#8217;t load correctly, I still need to fix it. everything else loads perfectly! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>During the weekend Surreal came over and we integrated most of the new menu:</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodsp/r400_1.png"><img class="aligncenter" title="DSP r400 menu" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodsp/r400_1.png" alt="" width="486" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>This required updating the fonts, and as the existing font system was&#8230;. unweildy, surreal forced me to rewrite it to use freetype. So now plugging in new sexy fonts is easy as!!!</p>
<p>Surreal provided a new font, so I plugged it in. Then as the new font system takes coordinates to draw at differently, I had to update everywhere text was rendered&#8230; zzz&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway, an example:</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodsp/r400_2.png"><img class="aligncenter" title="DSP r400 in game" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodsp/r400_2.png" alt="" width="486" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>Next week will be finishing the menu, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">fixing save/load for pathfind enemies</span>, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">code cleanup of the new font system</span>, perhaps some minor improvements to the pathfind system, end game handling and more&#8230;.</p>
<p>Edit: Crossing out items I&#8217;ve now done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An update on time-ish for once!</p>
<p>This week I drafted aÂ  main menu for the mouse UI, then Surreal created something that looks incredibly sexy based on my requirements. I haven&#8217;t integrated this yet, hopefully during the next week.</p>
<p>Instead, I implemented Save/Load. So when you have to quickly power off your PSP or quit your game, you can resume right where you left off!</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t yet complete, currently Shots don&#8217;t save, but I&#8217;m part way through implementing it, so I should finish it tomorrow.</p>
<p>No screenshots this week, as Save/Load doesn&#8217;t make for an interesting screenshot&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Got a bit more done on DSP this week, it finally cooled down enough that I could sit in front of my computer comfortably!</p>
<p>The PSP interface is now as functional as the mouse interface. It reuses all of the same interface components with some minor changes. Shown here is the tower upgrade menu. It looks relatively the same, but has the addition of the selector thing to the left to show you how to control it.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodsp/r361.png"><img class="aligncenter" title="DSP R361" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodsp/r361.png" alt="" width="486" height="302" /></a></p>
<p>What is left on the todo list&#8230; hhhmmmm&#8230;..</p>
<ul>
<li>Level select menu.</li>
<li>End game handling (What to do when you win or lose)</li>
<li>Minor balancing of River TD.</li>
<li>Create a path find level.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve drawn some drafts for the menus, will go through them and create something this week hopefully <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still hopeful of a February release, but it looks like it will probably slip to early March.<br />
When I get the engine complete I&#8217;ll release a test level for level developers to pull apart and get cracking on their own levels <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This should be a week or 2 before the release.</p>
