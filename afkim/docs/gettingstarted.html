</li>

<li>Now you will need to create your bitlbee account. bitlbee is the service which AFKIM uses to connect to all of the chat networks.
The username and password you enter here will be saved to your PSP, you won't need to enter them again.<br>
Enter your details using the danzeff keyboard, press digital-down (enter) to go to the next box, and again when you have entered your password to create the account.<br>
You might need to try a few times to choose a username that isn't already taken.<br>

AFKIM will now log you into bitlbee and connect to any of your chat accounts you have added. As you haven't added any yet, it will tell you that you need to add one. Press [SELECT] to pop up the menu.<br>

<li>You will be returned to the main afkim window, with any luck your account will connect and your buddy list will be filled with buddies. When your account is connected its icon will be colored, not connected accounts are shown in greyscale.<br>
If your account cannot connect the reason will be shown in the main window, you should remove your account before adding it again.<br>
Continue adding any other accounts you want to, then move on to <a href="usingafkim.html">How to use AFKIM.</a></li>
